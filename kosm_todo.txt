KOSM TODO :

sometimes fixed orb loses its audio event which is never rendered again ??

formant filter only for percussive sounds, re-introduce filter for sine and saw ?

occasional bugs :

CRASH with kicks still occurs  ???

later stage improvements:

temporarily increase delay feedback upon collision ?
introduce glitch effect ?
pitchshifting ? (for doppler esque effects)
add buffer size menu ?
